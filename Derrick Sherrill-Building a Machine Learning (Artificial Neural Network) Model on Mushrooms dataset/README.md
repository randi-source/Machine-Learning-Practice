# Derrick Sherrill-Building a Machine Learning (Artificial Neural Network) Model on Mushrooms dataset

This was a project that taught the audiences how to do Artificial Neural Network modelling by Derrick Sherrill on his youtube channell.
I was fortunate enough to start my learning from his project and guidance in the entire videos. 

This project mainly pointed to determine which mushroom is poisonous or edible based on the variables provided
